# HaploFHIR
A Prototype to Detect Baseline Haploblocks from Popular SNP Chips and Port them to EMRs

## Possibilities for LD Calculators

LDlookup (Purcell)

WhatsHap (Marschall)

LDlink (NCI) 

HaploBlocker (Torsten Pook)

+ Learned about this one at the biohackathon!

+ Tested on corn!

## Code framework

### Workplan

Will use Haploblocker to generate additional input data for graph genomes team (Monday, Tuesday)

Will think about how to extract reportable paths ("lava") from graphs, and figure out when they are touched by short and long reads (Wednesday)

Will figure out to extract gene level haplotypes from graphs and put them into FHIR (Thursday, Friday)
